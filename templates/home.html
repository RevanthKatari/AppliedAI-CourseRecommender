      <li>Students with prior MAC course work receive a hybrid recommendation that blends their history with lookalike peers.</li>
      <li>New or cold-start students curate interests so that we can match them with relevant skill builders.</li>
      <li>Every suggestion lists the top skills and peer uptake to keep the rationale transparent.</li>
